# Getting started with a basic Node Express Server

## 1. Create repo
Create a new repository with a readme.md file, gitignore file (chose node from the dropdown), and a Licence (we usually use MIT).

## 2. Clone to local machine and create new Branch
Clone the repository to your local machine and create a new local branch

## 3. npm init (npm init -y)
Your new repository now needs a package.json file. 
1. You have to choices on how to create this file.  
a. npm init =  this will present you with questions you need to hit y for yes or type in what you want.  
b. npm init -y = This will simply answer yes to all the questions.

## 4. npm install express
Much like in react you need node packages to run your server

1. npm i express is the first package or dependency to install

## touch index.js
Now you need your main server file.  Typically we use index.js for this.

1. Simply type touch index.js to create this file.
